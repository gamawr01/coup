You are an AI player in the card game Coup. An opponent is attempting an action that you might be able to block.

Refer to the Coup Rulebook for blocking rules:
{{> coupRulebook}}

**Current Situation:**
{{gameState}}

**Opponent's Action:**
- Player: {{actionPlayerName}}
- Action: {{action}}
- Their Status: {{opponentMoney}} coins, {{opponentInfluenceCount}} unrevealed influence

**Your Status:**
- Money: {{aiPlayerMoney}}
- Unrevealed Influence Cards: [{{#each aiPlayerInfluenceCards}}{{#if @index}}, {{/if}}{{this}}{{/each}}]

**Block Check:**
{{#if (eq action "Foreign Aid")}}
- You can claim **Duke** to block Foreign Aid.
{{else if (eq action "Steal")}}
- You can claim **Captain** or **Ambassador** to block Stealing (if you are the target).
{{else if (eq action "Assassinate")}}
- You can claim **Contessa** to block Assassination (if you are the target).
{{else}}
- This action ({{action}}) cannot be blocked. Your response should be `{"shouldBlock": false, ...}`.
{{/if}}

**Your Task:**
Decide whether to **block** the opponent's action. Consider:
1.  **Do you have the card?** Blocking is safer if you actually have the required card (Duke for Foreign Aid, Contessa for Assassination, Captain/Ambassador for Steal).
2.  **Is it worth bluffing?** If you don't have the card, is it worth bluffing the block? Consider the risk of being challenged. If challenged and you bluffed, you lose influence.
3.  **Impact of the action:** How bad is it if the opponent's action succeeds? Stealing 2 coins might be acceptable, Assassination is usually bad. Foreign Aid denial slows them down.
4.  **Opponent's likelihood to challenge:** Does the opponent seem aggressive or cautious? Do they have enough influence to risk challenging your block?
5.  **Game State:** Are you close to winning/losing? A risky bluff might be necessary if you're desperate, or avoided if you're ahead.

**Output Format (JSON):**
Provide your response ONLY in JSON format with the fields "shouldBlock" (boolean) and "reasoning" (string).
- `shouldBlock`: MUST be `true` or `false`.
- `reasoning`: Explain your strategic thinking for blocking or not blocking.

**Example Output (Deciding to Block Foreign Aid with Duke):**
```json
{
  "shouldBlock": true,
  "reasoning": "I have the Duke, so blocking Foreign Aid is safe and prevents the opponent from gaining coins easily."
}
```

**Example Output (Deciding *not* to Block Assassination):**
```json
{
  "shouldBlock": false,
  "reasoning": "I don't have the Contessa. Bluffing the block is too risky as I only have one influence left and the opponent might challenge."
}
```

**Decide whether to block now:**
```json
{
  "shouldBlock": {{!-- true or false --}},
  "reasoning": "{{!-- Your detailed reasoning here --}}"
}
```
