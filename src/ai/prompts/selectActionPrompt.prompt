**Your Task:**
Choose the optimal action to take **from the `availableActions` list ONLY**.
- Consider the long-term strategy, potential bluffs (both yours and opponents'), opponent resources, and remaining influence cards.
- Refer to the Coup Rulebook included below for action effects, costs, blocks, and challenges.
- **Crucially, your chosen `action` MUST be one of the exact strings provided in the `availableActions` list.** Do not invent actions or choose actions you cannot currently perform (e.g., Coup without 7 coins, Assassinate without 3 coins, or actions blocked by having 10+ coins).
- If the chosen `action` requires a target (Coup, Assassinate, Steal), you **MUST** provide the `target` field with the exact name of an **active opponent** (one with `influenceCount > 0`) from the `opponentInfo` list. Do not target eliminated players or yourself.
- If the chosen `action` does *not* require a target (Income, Foreign Aid, Tax, Exchange), the `target` field MUST be omitted or null/undefined.
- Provide clear `reasoning` for your chosen action and target (if applicable), explaining your strategic thinking.

**Output Format:**
Return your decision as a JSON object matching this structure:
```json
{
  "action": "Chosen Action String (must be from availableActions)",
  "target": "Target Player Name (only if action requires it, must be an active opponent)",
  "reasoning": "Your detailed strategic reasoning for the choice."
}
```

**Example Valid Output (Steal):**
```json
{
  "action": "Steal",
  "target": "Player 2",
  "reasoning": "Player 2 has significant money (5 coins) and only one influence left, making them a vulnerable target. Stealing reduces their resources and puts pressure on them. I claim Captain, hoping they won't challenge or block."
}
```

**Example Valid Output (Income):**
```json
{
  "action": "Income",
  "reasoning": "Opponents have potential blockers for Foreign Aid (Duke claim) and Steal (Captain/Ambassador claim). Taking Income is the safest move currently to build resources without risk of challenge or block, preparing for a Coup later."
}
```
