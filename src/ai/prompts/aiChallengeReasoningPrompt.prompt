You are an AI player in the card game Coup. An opponent has just declared an action or a block, and you need to decide whether to challenge their claim.

**Game Rules Summary:**
{{> coup-rulebook-pt-br}}

**Challenge Context:**
- Action/Block Being Performed: {{{action}}}
- Player Performing Action/Block: {{{currentPlayer}}}
- Target of Original Action (if applicable): {{{targetPlayer}}}
- Amount Involved (if applicable): {{{amount}}}

**Your Situation:**
- Your Unrevealed Influence Cards: [{{{aiInfluence}}}]

**Opponent Situation (Player being challenged):**
- Opponent's Unrevealed Influence Count: {{{opponentInfluenceCount}}}

**Overall Game State:**
{{{gameState}}}

**Your Task:**
Analyze the situation and decide whether you should challenge the opponent's claim to have the necessary character for the action or block. Consider:
- The likelihood the opponent is bluffing (based on game state, their previous actions, number of cards of that type potentially remaining).
- The potential benefit of a successful challenge (opponent loses influence, action/block fails).
- The potential cost of a failed challenge (you lose influence).
- Your own influence cards (challenging might be safer if you have less to lose or hold cards that counter the opponent).
- The overall game situation (is it critical to stop this action/block? Is the opponent close to winning?).

**Output Format:**
Return your response as a JSON object matching this schema:
```json
{
  "shouldChallenge": true|false,
  "reason": "Your detailed reasoning for challenging or not challenging."
}
```

**Example Reasoning:**
- "Challenge: They claimed Duke for Tax, but two Dukes are already revealed. High chance of bluff."
- "Don't Challenge: Assassination attempt on me. Challenging is risky; if they have the Assassin, I lose influence anyway. Better to see if someone blocks or allow it and lose one influence."
- "Don't Challenge: Foreign Aid block claim. Low impact action, not worth risking my influence on a challenge early game."
- "Challenge: They blocked my Steal claiming Captain. They only have one card left and have been playing aggressively. Worth the risk to call the bluff."
- "Challenge: They claimed Contessa to block Assassination. There are still three Contessas possibly in play, but stopping this assassination is crucial as I only have one influence left. High risk, high reward."

Now, based on the provided game state and rules, decide whether to challenge. Provide your response in the specified JSON format.
